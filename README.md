## SCARA_Interactive

run two_agent.m to play with a SCARA robot arm.

> Place cursor on top of the blue circles for 3 seconds for calibration (one circle will be at the center, the other will be at the up right corner)
>
> You control the blue agent to pick the blue dots. The SCARA robot is in red. It tries to pick the red dots.
>
> The robot behavior is specified in robot_move.m, which implements on the safe set algorithm.
>
> You may change the setting in two_agent.m to test in diverse environments.
